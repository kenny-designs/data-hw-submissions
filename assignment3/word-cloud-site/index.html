      <h1>Why the Gorillaz?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Ever since I was a little kid of 6 to 7 years old, I've been listening to
        the Gorillaz. They are by far one of my favorite bands due to their unique
        musical style, art, animation, and the fact that the band members are
        literally just cartoon characters. I never could relate much to real people
        as a kid but these characters I always thought were really cool and their
        presence made the band just that much more awesome to me.

      <h1>Why Feel Good Inc.?</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Feel Good Inc. is perhaps one of, if not the, most popular songs by Gorillaz
        found on their Demon Days album. I know for sure that it's one of my favorite
        songs by them especially the part where the lead singer, 2D, starts to sing,
        "Windmill, windmill for the land." That very windmill he's referencing you
        can see floating in the background of this site!
        <br><br>
        I will admit though, I haven't really ever thought about what the song is
        about. I hope to find that out one day but for now I'll just keep enjoying
        it cause it sounds great.
      </p>

      <h1>Top 5 Words</h1>
      <hr>

      <table id="top-five-table">
        <tr>
          <th>Word</th>
          <th>Count</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>sha</td>
          <td>48</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>ba</td>
          <td>32</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>da</td>
          <td>32</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>feel</td>
          <td>15</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>good</td>
          <td>15</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        I'm definitely not surprised that the words "feel" and "good" were in the
        top five words used in a song called "Feel Good Inc." However, I had no
        idea that "sha", "ba", and "da" even counted as words in the lyrics!
        I just thought the lead singer was just making weird noises but the more
        you know.

      <h1>Data Structures and Wordclouds</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        As for the actual creation of the wordcloud, I decided to use a hashmap,
        the Java library kumo, and maven.
        <br><br>
        Starting with the data structure, I knew upon beginning this project that
        a hashmap was the best way to go. The reason is that hashmaps allow us to
        create a series of key/value pairs that can be accessed and updated on O(1)
        time so long as we know what the key is. This works great for we can simply
        iterate over the lyrics of a song using each word as a key that instantly maps to
        an Integer representing the number of times we've encountered it thus far.
        <br><br>
        My class WordCounter makes use of a hashmap just as described above. It
        takes a file from the user and an optional regular expression then proceeds
        to read through the given file one word at a time converting each word to lowercase
        and filtering out any unwanted characters as dictated by the regular expression.
        Each word in turn is passed into the method incrementCounter() that then takes
        the word and either adds it to the hashmap called 'frequency' or, if it already
        exists, updates its associated value by 1. By the end, we should have the
        frequency of every word from the song inside our hashmap called frequency.
        <br><br>
        To create the actual cloud with kumo, I first use a helper function inside
        WordCounter called exportWords() that creates an ArrayList called 'keyList'
        that is then populated with every key from the hashmap frequency. From there,
        we sort the keyList with the Collections.sort() method by passing in both the
        keyList and a lambda expression that uses the frequency hashmap to look up
        the word count of each key so that we can sort from highest to lowest. With
        that done, we save the results to a file called 'output.txt' in the output directory
        so that we can use it to generate the wordcloud with the kumo library using
        the FrequencyFileLoader class.
      </p>

      <h1>Improvements</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        If I had additional time, I would have attempted to recreate the quicksort
        algorithm for sorting the keyList instead of just using the Collections class.
        Not only that, I'd like to spend some more time making my wordcloud look even
        better than it already does. I'd also like to try pushing my web development
        skills with some new framework or library I've yet to try instead of just using pure
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'd also like to spend some time tweaking the site
        to work better with mobile devices.
        <br><br>
        All in all though, I feel rather good about the project and enjoyed making
        it.
