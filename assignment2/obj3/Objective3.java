   * Due to the way I will be reading in data, this method is imperative for it
   * accepts two LinkLists then checks if they overlap from their tails forward.
   * If there is any overlap, then the method will have both lists point to the
   * beginning of the intersection where they naturally should. For example,
   * lets say we read in the following two lines:
   *
   *     1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 9, 0  // shifted to bring attention to where they overlap
   *  1, 3, 10, 1, 8, 15, 9, 0
   *
   * When first converted into linked lists, previous two lines will have each
   * node point to eachother like so:
   *
   *       [1]->[2]->[5]->[10]->[15]->[9]->[0]  // shifted again to aid visualizing the overlap
   *  [1]->[3]->[10]->[1]->[8]->[15]->[9]->[0]
   *
   * Despite them both lists ending in 15, 9, and 0, there are two completely separate nodes
   * holding the value 15 that point to two completely separate nodes holding the value
   * 9, and then the same with the nodes holding value 0.
   *
   * At this point, the two lists don't actually intersect via reference for there
   * are two completely different nodes holding the value of 15 in each list.
   *
   * What the createIntersection() method will do from here is have both lists
   * reference the same node with value 15 where they naturally should. As such,
   * both lists now intersect with eachother due to reference. The final result
   * will look like this:
   *
   *       [1]->[2]->[5]->[10]--+
   *                            |
   *                            +-->[15]->[9]->[0]
   *                            |
   *  [1]->[3]->[10]->[1]->[8]--+
   *
   * @param list1 The first list we wish to have intersect with the second
   * @param list2 The second list we wish to have intersect with the first
