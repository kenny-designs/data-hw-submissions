Running and Compilation Works as Follows:
-

To compile the program as a whole
```
javac Assignment2
```

To run objective 1 with test input
```
java Assignment2 1 < obj1/input.txt
```

To run objective 2 with test input
```
java Assignment2 2 < obj2/input.txt
```

To run objective 3 with test input
```
java Assignment2 3 < obj3/input.txt
```

To run objective 4 with test input
```
java Assignment2 4 < obj4/input.txt
```

To use your own input, replace the text following the '<' symbol with your own
file.

Instructions For Each Objective
-
All objectives work best by supplying a file resembling the input.txt files in
each obj directory. For objectives 1 and 4, the program reads each line one at
a time. Objectives 2 and 3 are read two lines at a time. Whenever invalid input
is encountered, such as supplying characters instead of numbers to obj1, then an
exception is thrown alerting the user to which line is incorrect before moving on
to the next line/pair of lines.

Big Note on Objective3
-
For Objective3, I read two lines at a time then see if they overlap such as the
following:

```
1 2 3 10 15 20
  9 6 10 15 20 // shifted to the right to help show where they overlap
```

My program then creates two Linked Lists that connect the overlapping parts together
like so:

```
[1]->[2]->[3]--+
               |->[10]->[15]->[20]
     [9]->[6]--+
```

Each [ ] represents a node and the number inside the is data held by said node. Now
that the program has forced these two lists to intersect, I use my method
findIntersectingLink() to retrieve the node where they intersect. If they don't
intersect at all then it returns null.

The main reason I point this all out is that the example input/output on the website
shows the following:

```
[1,3,5,7] and [2,4,5,6] â€”> the lists intersect at 5
```

I reason that it's impossible for the node holding the data value 5 to be where they
intersect via reference for this implies that a single Link can point to two separate
nodes when it can only point to a single other node. If this was based on value, then
this would be fine. We can have one node with value 5 point to a node with value 6 and then
a separate node with value 5 pointing to a node with value 7. However, the intersection
is based on reference which means there is only ever a single node with value 5 in this
case. As such, it can only point to 6 or 7 but not both. On the contrary, any number of
nodes can point to a single node with data value 5 and that would be okay but it doesn't
work the other way around unless we made some big changes to how our singly linked list
works.
